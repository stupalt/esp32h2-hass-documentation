# esp32-h2-documentation
Documentation on how to use the ESP32-H2 in Home Assistant (WIP)

# The goal of this repository
Espressif has released a chipset with Zigbee and Thread capabilities. However, very little information on how to program this chipset is availible. This repository aims to condense all availible information about programming the chipset to make it work via Zigbee.  The documentation will focus on how to program and use the ESP32-H2 in Home Assistant, preferably through Zigbee2MQTT and alternatively through ZHA as a devboard to make your own IoT devices.
